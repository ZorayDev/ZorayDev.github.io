    It may or may not come as a surpise to you that I've actually decided to write this Mid-Year Report for you. Before I move on with actually detailing just how much I deserve to hold unto this position for a minimum of 6 more months, I think it makes sense for me to explain why I've decided to even do this! First and foremost, I think it provides a sense of comic relief. The main reason, however, is that I'm trying to practice the skills that I've learned in this Coding class that I'm taking and I figured that the best way to do this is to make a semi-practical website. Now, unto the fun part, the review.

        These last few months working here have been unique to say the least. When I consider what this job has done for me, I recognize that it's opened up my "realm of possibilities", I realize that there is more to life than what I had previously considered realistic, possible, feasible, or even enjoyable. I've acquired the not-so unique skill of motor-vehicular operation and have since acquired a motor-vehicle of my own, lets call her Ash. She has helped me pick you up from work and take you on a much longer commute to my house than need-be. I also understand that you're not always the biggest fan of driving in traffic so not having to drive sometimes should earn me some basic points, lets say 1/1. I'm still working on some other skills like dancing so you'll have to be patient while I acquired the tools of the trade, it's only been a few months!

        I know that you originally asked for this report to be typed out, single spaced, 12 font and in Times New Roman so presenting this in a website format instead leaves you with two possible thoughts. Option A, "this nigga can't listen, I clearled asked for abc and this man product xyz, hello?". OR, option b "This nigga can't listen, but I gotta give him props for being bold, and stupid, and extra enough to ACTUALLY do this 5/5 for effort.". I know that we've already gone through a few interesting situations, but thats inevitable and to be expected when you're as honest as we tend to be with each other, I'll call that a positive. Lets go do some fun new stuff this summer, we've eaten at a bunch of cool spots, tried out some fun activities, played some not-very competitive games but oii, it has certainly been a fun time.
