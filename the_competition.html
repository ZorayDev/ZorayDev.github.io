          Andrea was just barely able to clinch out a victory in the first, and only, game of beer-pong that they've played againts each other. It started out heated, after making her way through most of the boys squad, she got up to Ray and it seems the nerves hit hard. Andrea seemed mortal, she could simply not sink shots and Ray took a comfortable lead to start the game. Unfortunately, due to circumstances not fully within his control, he simply was not able to clutch up the victory and lost the game to a clutch last few shots by Andrea. I think that this particular part of the competition deserves atleast a best 3 out of 5, but for now, Andrea is holding the W.
          <ul id="ps"> Winner: Andrea!</ul>

          Andrea took a decided victory in Basketball, after warming up in jeans, they decided to play a few games of HORSE and the results simply spoke for themselves. Andrea was able to draw on her past as an athelete and took a simply victory over Ray who looked like he needed glasses. Not much to be said here...

        What an ASS whooping Andrea received when she tried, to no avail, to turn Ray's powerful body over unto his back. She consistently critiques his workout style for being too "body building styled", but the one advantage it was able to give him so far was pure strength. Andrea tried to have one last ditch effort when she spider clung to his body but his will was simply too strong, they fell to the floor together sending a thundering roar through the house where she proceeded to admit defeat.
        <ul id="ps"> Winner: Ray!</ul>

        Andrea decided that it would be really "fun" to take Ray to the bowling alley so he could learn how to bowl. Naturally, being as competitive as they are, it was only a matter of time before they decided to "up the ante" and add this sport to their competition. Ray knew he stood a low chance of winning versus a career bowler, but he took the shot anyways. He is afterall, never going to backdown from a challenge. The ass-whooping was to be expected.... Ray was not able to take a single round off Andrea.

    Andrea currently sitting at a comfortable lead but the question remains, will she stay there for the rest of the 2021 olympics or will she fall... Only time will tell. 
    <ul id="ps">  As it stands 
      <p> Andrea:3 </p>
        <p> Ray :1</p></ul>
